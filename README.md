This is a program for carrying out calculations on matrixes.
To run this program you need a golang compiler (it's recommended that you have more recent version)
And the rest is just simple, run "go run cmd/main.go" and the program will start
This is just for practice, and I haven't tested it very much
There are may be changes and updates in the future
